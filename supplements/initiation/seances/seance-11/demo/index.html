					<span class="name">Jeffrey Zeldman</span> publishes <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> “for people who make websites,” a leading journal of web and interaction design thought, and co-founded the multi-city user experience design conference An Event Apart with Eric Meyer. Since February 2019, Jeffrey has served as a Creative Director at Automattic, the people behind WordPress.com, where he collaborates on websites that exemplify what WordPress can be, and works to spread web standards, accessibility, content wisdom, and design love throughout the organization.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Jeffrey has written two books, notably the foundational web standards text, Designing With Web Standards, currently in a 3rd Edition coauthored with Ethan Marcotte. It has been translated into 15 languages, including (for the last edition) Italian, Chinese, Hungarian, Polish and Portuguese. The book, together with The Web Standards Project which Jeffrey co-founded in 1998 and led from 1999–2003, is widely credited with converting the web design industry from tag soup and Flash to semantics and accessibility via correct use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. His first book, Taking Your Talent to The Web, is now available as a free download and website.
